 CS 160, Fall 2014
Programming Quiz Q4
First Java Midterm

Must be completed during recitation on Sep. 25.
You have 50 minutes to complete the quiz.

    You CANNOT use any outside resources
    - This includes the internet, past recitations or programs, textbooks, notes, friends, enemies, classmates, cell phones, tablets, laptops, etc.
    Any and all questions should be directed to your TA and your TA's helper. 

Here are the instructions for the programming quiz:

    Create a project called Q4 in Eclipse.
    Create a class called Q4 in the project Q4 with a main method.
    Put the code shown below in the main method of Q4.java.
    Write the rest of your code in the main method, below the code shown.

            // Declare variables
            int int0=0, int1=0, int2=0;
            double real0=0.0, real1=0.0, real2=0.0;
            String string0="", string1="", string2="";
            boolean p = true, q = true, r = false;

            try {

                // Open input stream
                Scanner scan = new Scanner(new File("data.txt"));

                // Read contents
                string0 = scan.nextLine();
                string1 = scan.nextLine();
                string2 = scan.nextLine();
                int0 = scan.nextInt();
                int1 = scan.nextInt();
                int2 = scan.nextInt();
                real0 = scan.nextDouble();
                real1 = scan.nextDouble();
                real2 = scan.nextDouble();
                p = scan.nextBoolean();
                q = scan.nextBoolean();
                r = scan.nextBoolean();

                // Close input stream
                scan.close();

            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("Cannot read file: data.txt");
                System.exit(0);
            }

    Use Eclipse to add the imports needed for the above code.
    Copy the data file into data.txt into the Q4 project (~/workspace/Q4).
    Follow the instructions from the TA to complete the programming quiz.
    Make sure your Q4.java compiles and produces exactly 10 lines of output.
    Submit your Q4.java to the RamCT dropbox for this programming quiz.
    WARNING: Only one submission is allowed! 



Note: The variables have already been defined and read from a file in the provided code, do not redeclare or assign your own values to the variables! Start with the provided code, then add your code below to do steps A-J. Do not print anything except what is specified below, any extra output will cause you to lose points. You are free to open data.txt in Eclipse to see its contents. However, we will test your program using different versions of data.txt too.

IMPORTANT: Do the steps in order and make sure that each step A-J produces exactly one line of output!

A) Print an expression that adds int0, int1, and int2, then multiplies the result by 123. (10 points)
B) Print an expression that subtracts real1 from real2, then divides the result by 3.5. (10 points)
C) Print the result of int2 multiplied by real1 with exactly 7 digits after the decimal. (10 points)
D) Print an expression with the concatenation of "Java programming is " and the 14th, 12th, 15th, and 13th character of string0, not separated by any spaces. (10 points)
E) Print the first characters of string0, string1, and string2, separated by commas. (10 points)
F) Print the boolean that is returned from a comparison of the contents of string0 and string2 using the appropriate String method. (10 points)
G) Print the result of the boolean expression (p∨q)∧(q∨¬r). (10 points)
H) Write an if/else statement as follows (10 points):

    Print "9 characters or fewer!" if the length of string1 is less than 10.
    Otherwise print "10 characters or more!" if the length of string1 is 10 or more. 

I) Write a conditional statement as follows (10 points):

    Print (real1 + 1.234), if real1 < 8.67.
    Print (real1 / 0.531), if real1 > 11.2 and real1 ≤ 23.6.
    Otherwise print (real1 * real1 / 4.221). 

J)Write a switch statement as follows (10 points):

    The switch statement should check the value of string1.
    If string1 equals "Mexico City" or "Denver", use System.out.println() to print the string "North America".
    If string1 equals "Santiago" or "Lima", use System.out.println() to print the string "South America".
    Otherwise using System.out.println() to print the string "Unknown City". 


You must submit your Q4.java program to the RamCT drop box to get graded for Programming Quiz 4.
